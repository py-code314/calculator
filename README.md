# Calculator
## TOP project: Build a calculator with Javascript


## Description
This simple calculator is created with Javascript. You can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using this calculator. It features a small numeric on-screen keypad with buttons 0 through 9, along with operational buttons like +, -, *, and /. The calculator also include an All Clear button that resets the calculator to 0 and a Clear button that clears the last entry. This calculator also has a decimal button so that you can work with decimal point numbers. I hope this little project from me will help you do everyday simple calculations.


## How to use
* Use the number buttons **0 through 9** to enter numbers.
* Use the **decimal** button to enter decimal numbers.
* Use arithmetic operators **'+, -, *, and /'** to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division respectively.
* Use **= or Enter/Return** to get the result of the calculation.
* Use **%** to get the percentage of a number.
* Use **+/-** to change the number into positive or negative.
* Use **AC or Esc** button to reset all the functions and clear the display.
* Use **C or Backspace/Delete** to clear the last entry.


## Things to remember
* This calculator limits the number of digits that can be entered to 8.
* You can do more than one calculation at a time without resetting the calculator.
* If you click on an operator button without first entering a number, you will get an error.
* The calculator decreases the font size of the result when the number of digits exceeds 8.
* If there are multiple digits after the decimal point in the result, you will get a rounded number to 2 decimal places.
* There is a keyboard support for this calculator so that you can use your keyboard to perform calculations.
